Insecure Permissions vulnerability in Nagios Network Analyzer v.2024R1.02-64 and before allows a local attacker to escalate privileges via the remove_source.sh component.

Nagios Network Analyzer VM's default setup grants the "nna" user sudo permissions to execute specific scripts. These permissions can be exploited to alter script behaviors, enabling a Privilege Escalation Attack. Thus, even with/without password changes, a normal user can escalate to Superuser (root), gaining full system control through the misuse of sudo rights.

Affected Component:
 /usr/local/nagiosna/scripts/remove_source.sh
