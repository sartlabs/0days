Default Sudo Permissions Granted to Normal User in Nagios Log Server VM Appliance.

Nagios Log Server 2024R1.0.1-64 and below versions

In the default VM appliance of Nagios Log Server, normal user (nagios) is erroneously assigned sudo permissions, potentially allowing unauthorized privilege escalation and system compromise. 
This flaw requires immediate attention to mitigate potential security breaches.

Nagios Log Server VM's default setup grants the "nagios" user sudo permissions to execute specific scripts. These permissions can be exploited to alter script behaviors, enabling a Privilege Escalation Attack. 
Thus, even with/without password changes, a normal user can escalate to Superuser (root), gaining full system control through the misuse of sudo rights.
